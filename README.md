<h1>🗳️ Electoral Roll Tracker</h1>

<h3>Forensic Auditing of Electoral Roll Changes at National Scale</h3>

<p>
Electoral manipulation doesn’t happen loudly.  
It hides inside silent data changes — <b>additions, deletions, and subtle modifications</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Electoral Roll Tracker</b> is a civic-tech platform that detects, audits, and visualizes suspicious changes in voter rolls —  
<i>like Git Diff for Democracy</i>.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **Electoral roll manipulation hides in silent data changes, not in static voter lists.**

With frequent voter list updates across regions, it becomes extremely difficult to detect:
- Mass voter deletions  
- Artificial voter insertions  
- Suspicious demographic shifts  
- Synthetic or duplicated voter records  

This platform provides **forensic-grade auditing** aligned with the vision of  
🇮🇳 **One Nation, One Election**.

## ⚙️ Technological Approach

### 🔍 Pre-Processing Intelligence
- Detects unnatural voter movement using age, gender, time & migration patterns  
- Identifies fake voter clusters via address & relationship similarity  
- Flags impossible voter densities using spatial clustering  
- Detects synthetic data through low randomness patterns  
- Assigns **probabilistic risk scores** instead of binary flags  

### 🧩 Core Concept
**Version control for democracy**

Two electoral roll versions are compared to identify:
- ➕ Additions  
- ➖ Deletions  
- ✏️ Modifications  

All changes are visualized with clear statistics and highlights.
